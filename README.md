<h1>Concepts developed</h1>

Materials, basic animations, cameras, 2D elements in 3d environment

<h1> Working of project</h1>
<p> The Sun is at the center rotating on this own position (0,0) after that each planet has given a specific position on x-axis on which every planet is also individually rotating on its own path. The earth has moon attached to it which also is rotating around the earth, i gave earth the parent of moon. Saturn has ring which is actually a torus mesh around saturn. Each planet, moon & sun has given the texture by local library itself availabe in the main branch. </p>
